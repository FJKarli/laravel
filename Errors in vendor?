I'm a starting using Laravel and noticed, that - I think - Composer delivers 2 faulty files in the directory
app/vendor/symfony/translation/Symfony/Component/Translation/Tests/fixtures
empty.json is empty but I think it should contain {}

and

malformed.json
{
    "foo": "bar" "
}
(May be that's the reason, that the files name is malformed ;-))
